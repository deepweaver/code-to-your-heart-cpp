# naughty_cpp
some simple c++ code to play with

1. light_her_heart.cpp displays a ascii heart shape. Just a simple trick to entertain girls(boys of course). When s/he ask for your help of their coding homework , put this piece of code in her work! ;)

2. perceptron.cpp is a c++ version of one layer perceptron. Have fun. I have an [article](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35454765) explaining the mechanism of this toy model.
